	      <h4>Kenyon STEM Scholar Program - Kenyon College: Summer of 2022</h4>
	        <ul>
	          <li>Took classes that helped me understand the scientific processes of labs/experiments and 
		how to read scientific papers along with presenting my own research in an effective way</li>
	          <li>Also took a writing course that reinforced writing methods for argumentative and	analytical papers</li>
	        </ul>
	      <h4>Kenyon Professional Extension Project (PEP) - Kenyon College: Winter 2023 into 2024</h4>
	        <ul>
	          <li>A project oriented around bioinformatics algorithms where we find solutions to many problems in the bioinformatics field. I meet with a Professor, Jeff Parker, online and discuss problems and how I can be a better computer programmer by improving the efficiency of code and how to tackle certain problems in an effective way. Done all in Python and problems all from the Rosalind website.</li>
